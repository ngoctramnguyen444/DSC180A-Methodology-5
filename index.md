**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**\

The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is SDG&E Wildfire Safety Advancements. They have taken measures to enhance communication and provide real-time updates on weather forecasts, fire potential, and power shutoffs through their app. SDG&E also used drone technology for detailed inspections of power lines, which is a big step forward in wildfire risk mitigation.


**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**\

For the quarter 2 Project, I would like to explore the intersection of vegetation management and wildfire safety. Particularly, I aim to develop methods to minimize the risk of vegetation-induced disruptions to power lines, using advanced object detection models such as DETR.
- Use object detection to monitor vegetation growth near power lines. Monitor the health and growth of street trees, identify those that need trimming. Identify areas where vegetation encroaches on power lines.
- With Google Street View as a data source, detect and monitor the condition of utility poles and nearby vegetation. Identify poles that are at risk of falling or being impacted by vegetation. 
- Implement a system that tracks changes in vegetation over time. Analyze historical and current images to identify rapid vegetation growth or dying vegetation, which can be particularly prone to catching fire.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**\

Building upon Quarter 1's project, I'm considering the adoption of diverse modeling approaches. Specifically, combining multiple models' predictions to improve accuracy and reliability. I can also focus more on cloud computing resources to scale up the project.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**\

- I would like to try integrating a user-friendly UI with the object detection model which allows users to engage with the model for real-time wildfire risk analysis.
- Develop an application that uses object detection to educate homeowners about potential fire hazards around their properties.
- Use Street View images to enrich training dataset, providing more diverse and comprehensive training data for the object detection model.
- Enhance the resolution of images from Google Street View to detect fine details, such as small vegetation or minor damage to infrastructure that could pose fire risks.
